<h3>How to run test cases ?</h3>

[test.py](/test/test.py) file contains test cases for this application. 
To run these tests you need these python packages :
1) unittest
2) sys
3) main (This is the code for the application which resided in the \code folder)

After installing all of these requirements, run test.py using terminal. 

If any of the test cases fail a message with expected answer will be printed. For example :

![alt text](/data/images/failed_test_case.PNG)

If all of the test cases pass successfully, terminal will look like this :

![alt text](/data/images/all_test_cases_passed.PNG)
