## How to contribute?
- Commit Message Format
  - Do not directly commit anything to the main branch
  - Always create your own branch to code. Branch naming format: "KAPSS-{username}-{patch-no}-{change_info}"
  - Push the changes to your branch and create a pull request. 

- Pull Request Process
  - There is main branch protection instated in the repository. Thus, one needs an approval before merging any branches into main branch
  - Once you are done with the code changes, issue a pull request and one of the contributers will review these changes for you.
  - Do not merge your own pull request by yourself.
  - If aprrover denies your changes/asks you to make changes in the code before merging your branch into main branch, please respect the decision and do not use any offensive language.
